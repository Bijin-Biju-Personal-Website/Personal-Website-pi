        <h1>The Leader of the Illuminati</h1>
    <h3> 
        The current leader of the secret group known as the Illuminati. Orginally founded to fight against tryany, superstition, and other evils, later the society's reputation was tarnished by the constant misinformation campaign by the tryants. I was in deep sleep for decades due to the injuries suffered, and only recovered recently. Under a new persona, I am currently learning computers especially the vast internet that developed rapidly during my absence.
